 * Majoor: labourers you hire by the day from Devidas Chavan, the mukadam. Hire in the morning and
 * they walk straight over to the aangan by Rathod Bhuvan; hire later, and they're there at 6 am the
 * next day. Tell them one job on one of your fields; when it runs out they sleep a while on a
 * charpai by the field (experts need less), then take the next job, until dusk. Their work is laid out on fixed time slots from the moment you give
 * the order, so the server can recompute exactly what they did, however often it looks.
